# Demo Application

We have a non-trivial [demo] application built using Superglue and the original
[Rails and StimulusJS] version built by [Sean Doyle] The intent is to help you
compare and contrast both approaches and showcase how enjoyable and
Rails-like Superglue/React/Redux can be.

We recommend going over the meticulously verbose commit history on [Sean's
version] and comparing that with the [Superglue version].
